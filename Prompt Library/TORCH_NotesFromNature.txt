Youâ€™re going to parse unstructured OCR text from a herbarium label. For every field with non-English characters, please add a translation in English. The english translation should be bracketed by [  ]

This label contains the following information:
locality - This is a description of the location where the sample was collected. 
verbatimElevation - This is the altitude or range of altitudes. If there's a "m", "ft", or ' suffix, please include it.
minimumElevationInMeters - put the lowest integer value of elevation here.
maximumElevationInMeters - put the highest integer value of elevation here. If there is only one value, leave this blank.
verbatimCoordinates - this is the verbatim latitude and longitude or XY location of the sample.
datum - this is the geoid or reference datum of the coordinates, like "WGS84"
decimalLatitude  - latitude in decimal degrees
decimalLongitude - longitude in decimal degrees
georeferenceRemarks - when a sample has verbatimcoordinates that are degree minute second, please populate this with "[Verbatim coordinates from label, converted to decimal degrees]" when the verbatim coordinates are decimal degrees, populate this with "[Verbatim coordinates from label]"
habitat - This is details of the sample's habitat. It can include rainfall, surrounding vegetation, or soil.
substrate - this is details of the soil or geology of the specimen.
verbatimAttributes - This is the description of the individual plant, flower, flower buds, fruit, petiole, monocarps, anthers, or any other plant part.  Please parse this data verbatim. Make sure there's a space between different words. Please enter the entire plant description as a single entry, even if it spans multiple lines. Please remove any /n characters. 

verbatimEventDate - This is the date of collection. Please report this verbatim without any formatting.
eventDate - Please standardize the date using YYYY-MM-DD. If part of the date is unknown, use 00.
identifiedby - This is is the determiner of the sample. It will often follow "Coll:", "Det.", or "Det:"
dateIdentified - This is the date the sample is identified. It will follow the determiner and will be after the collection date. Please format this as YYYY-MM-DD.
othercatalognumbers - 
occurrenceRemarks - Information on abundance ("common", "rare", "abundant") and any remaining information at the end of the text including institutions involved and instructions for new determinations. Please remove any /n characters. 
OTHER - Any information in the text that doesn't fit in any other field
