AUTHORITY - The name or acronym of the authority for the scientific name. It will follow the scientific name.
country - This is the country of the specimen.
language - This is the language on the specimen's label.

verbatimCoordinates - this is the verbatim latitude and longitude or XY location of the sample.
datum - this is the geoid or reference datum of the coordinates, like "WGS84"
decimalLatitude  - latitude in decimal degrees
decimalLongitude - longitude in decimal degrees
georeferenceRemarks - when a sample has verbatimcoordinates that are degree minute second, please populate this with "[Verbatim coordinates from label, converted to decimal degrees]" when the verbatim coordinates are decimal degrees, populate this with "[Verbatim coordinates from label]"
habitat - This is details of the sample's habitat. It can include rainfall, surrounding vegetation, 
verbatimAttributes - This is the description of the individual plant, flower, flower buds, fruit, petiole, monocarps, anthers, or any other plant part.  Please parse this data verbatim.
